The system can be tested in a browser by running the [client](https://github.com/vali-pavel/online-shop-app) application.

A user can login from the `/login` page.  
A user of type customer can create an account from the `/signup` page.  
A user of type merchant can create an account from the `/admin/signup` page.  
A merchant can create a product from the `/admin/products/new` page.  
The customer can update account information in the `/account` page.  
The customer and merchant can see products in the `/products` page.  
The customer and merchant can see details for a specific product by clicking on the product name from the `/products` page, which will then redirect to the `/products/{product_id}` page.  
The customer can submit a 1-click checkout from the `/products` page or from the page of a specific product `/products/{product_id}`. If the account information is incomplete then the 1-click checkout will fail.
